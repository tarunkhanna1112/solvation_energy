THIS SCRIPT COMPARES THE SOLVATION ENERGY CALCULATED THROUGH AMBER MOLECULAR MECHANICS FORCE FIELD WITH THE SOLVATION ENERGY CALCULATED THROUGH GAUSSIAN QUANTUM MECHANICAL CALCULATIONS, BOTH AMBER AND GAUSSIAN ARE CALLED FROM THE SCRIPT AND IN ORDER TO AVOID THE EFFECT OF SMALLER BASIS SET WE PERFORM COUTERPOISE CALCULATION FOR THE LATTER WITH THE WATER AROUND THE MOLECULES EXPLICITLY PRESENT AND THE NUMBER OF WATERS ARE CALCULATED PER ATOM BASIS BASED ON THE PARTIAL CHARGE OF THE ATOMS. NUMBER OF WATER AND HENCE THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM FOR QM CALCULATIONS CAN BE SCALED UP OR DOWN BY INCREASING OR DECREASING THE SCALE_FACTOR. THE INOUT FOR THIS CODE IS CONTROLLED BY THE SEPARATE 'INPUT FILE'
